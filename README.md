# Meta-Llama-3.1-8BxColab

Meta Llama 3.1 is the latest open source LLM released by meta and also the most capable one right now. It supports 8 Languages `English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai`. Here you can run that model for free on the free `T4 Gpu` of google colab.

The free tier only works for the [8B Model](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct), NOTE: You will need to get the access of meta Llama3.1 from huggingface

‚ùóNOTE: Colab pro version recommended for faster inference. For free users i recommend to use the "Llama 3.1-8B_QuantisedxOllama" notebook. Because it will save you a lot of time. It has faster inference, smaller model size and you don't need any access to get the model, but quantisation comes with some cons such as it could make more mistakes and cause hallucination, so always check for important info.
